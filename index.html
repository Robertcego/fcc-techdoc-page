                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                        language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                        the
                        objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set
                        of
                        language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                        extended
                        for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser
                            and
                            its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                            place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                            and
                            page navigation.</li>
                        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                            JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to
                            communicate
                            with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                            application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </ul>

                    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                        JavaScript
                        language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                        JavaScript
                        follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which
                        was the
                        reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                        variables,
                        classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private,
                        or
                        protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function
                        return types
                        are not explicitly typed.</p>
                </section>
                <br>
                <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                    <header>Variables</header>
                    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                        called
                        identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                    <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                        characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                        characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                    <code>var x = 42.</code>
                </section>

                <section class="main-section" id="Scope">
                    <header>Scope</header>
                    <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it
                        is
                        available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a
                        function, it
                        is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable
                        declared within
                        a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example
                        the
                        following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within
                        which x is
                        declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                    <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                    <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                    <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                        defined</code>

                    <header>Functions</header>
                    <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                        function keyword, followed by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name of the function.</li>
                        <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                        <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                    <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                    <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement
                        that says
                        to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                        statement
                        specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
                    <code>return number * number;</code>
